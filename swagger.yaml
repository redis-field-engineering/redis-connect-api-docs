      summary: STOP Job
      description: Stops a job including all job partitions. You cannot stop initial load jobs since they are removed automatically upon completion. For a job to be stopped, all job partitions must be active. Job claims, metrics, and checkpoints will all  be preserved upon a job stop, so it can resume from where it left off.

      summary: START Job
      description: Starts a job including all job partitions. This includes both initial load and stream jobs. For a job to be started, all job partitions must be stopped or never before been started. There is no guarantee on which cluster member will claim a job partition and there is no advantage to initiating this operation from a specific cluster member. Before a start is initiated, a job configuration must be created and a validation to confirm enough remaining capacity exists across the cluster for all job partitions (this does not apply to initial load). Both source and target databases will have their connections validated along with the file paths from which credentials are read. Once a job is started, partitioning will happen automatically based on the job configuration. If a previously stopped job is started, it will remove all previous job claims since its partition strategy might have been different.

      summary: MIGRATE Job (Partition)
      description: Migrates a job, for the provided jobId, from its current cluster member to another with remaining job capacity. Keep in mind, for partitioned jobs, jobId represents only a single job partition. Partitioned jobs cannot have more than one partition migrated at the same time. For a migration to be initiated, there has to be at least one cluster member with remaining capacity. Once a migration begins, the cluster member that formerly claimed this jobId will be blacklisted so it cannot reclaim it. This blacklist designation will be removed once the job is claimed by another cluster member. This operation is typically performed for planned server outages as in the case of OS patching.

Each cluster member uses their clusterMemberId as a unique consumer name for isolation purposes.
